The binary I built exceeded Githubs limits.

The support files will be updated here.
However, for the executable you will need to go to
the release.

Go to main page of my repository,
on the right side, you should see releases,
click on it, you will find the lastest release and can download it.
Unpack everything to folder of choice.
