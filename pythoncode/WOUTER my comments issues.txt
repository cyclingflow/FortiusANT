=>Possible Bug:
usbTrainer around line 156
"imagic_fw  = os.path.join(dirname, 'tacximagic_1902_firmware.hex')"
The use of dirname.

I used the same mechanism for power factros file,
but it turns out the .exe file can not find it.
Doe this apply to your hex files as well?


=>Suggestion other copy running?
Would it not be nice to have FortiusAnt test
for another copy already running?
It now hangs with a lot of error message because
the ant/usb interface is not available.
